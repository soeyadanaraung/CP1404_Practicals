## About the Author
My name is Soe Yadanar Aung, and I'm a student in CP1404. This repository showcases my progress and learning in 
programming and coding best practices.

## Lessons Learned
Here are three main lessons I've learned about writing clean code in CP1404:
- **Readability**: Writing code that is easy to read and understand is essential for maintainability.
- **Consistency**: Consistent formatting and naming make the code easier to follow and reduce errors.
- **Modularity**: Breaking code into small, reusable functions and classes helps make it organized and easier to debug.
